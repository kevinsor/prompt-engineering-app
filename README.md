## üéì Educational Philosophy

### **Learn to Learn with AI**
This app teaches students to use AI as a **learning partner**, not a replacement for thinking. Students learn to:

- **Ask better questions** that promote understanding
- **Request step-by-step guidance** rather than direct answers
- **Check their understanding** through AI-guided reflection
- **Connect new knowledge** to what they already know
- **Apply concepts** to real-world situations

### **Universal Skills**
The prompt engineering techniques taught in this app work with:
- **ChatGPT** (OpenAI)
- **Claude** (Anthropic)  
- **Gemini** (Google)
- **Copilot** (Microsoft)
- **Any other AI system**
